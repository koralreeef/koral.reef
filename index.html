    <p>I do love <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>web development</strong>, 
        it is actually very cool when you design a <strong>good looking website
        </strong> that is also <strong>user-friendly</strong>. 
        <a href="https://koralreef.carrd.co/" title="Isn't this fun?">
        Here's my actual website.</a> Also,
        <a href="https://github.com/koralreeef/koralreeef.github.io" title="Isn't this fun?">
        here's my github repo!</a>

    <p>I do love <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>web development</strong>, 
        it is actually very cool when you design a <strong>good looking website
        </strong> that is also <strong>user-friendly</strong>. 
        <a href="https://koralreef.carrd.co/" title="Isn't this fun?">
        Here's my actual website.</a> 
        <br>Wow! I'll also put a drawing just for you since you got this far!</p>
